# Nerdbank.Algorithms for Rust

[![Build status](https://github.com/AArnott/Nerdbank.Algorithms.rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AArnott/Nerdbank.Algorithms.rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

This project contains a collection of popular algorithms I've found useful in some fun projects.

## Work in progress

I'm very new to rust and this is my first attempt at a real project.
Your kind feedback welcome.

## Constraints solution engine

The `SolutionBuilder` crate will help to find the one (or many) solutions to any problem that you can express in terms of nodes and constraints.

This is a rust port of my .NET [Nerdbank.Algorithms library](https://github.com/AArnott/Nerdbank.Algorithms).
